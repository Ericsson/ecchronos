# REST interfaces

ecChronos provides a REST interface to perform operations.
The REST API is documented using OpenAPI specification, the specification can be found in `docs/autogenerated` folder.

To view the OpenAPI specification in a more user-friendly way, there are several ways:

* Use favourite editor and install a plugin to view OpenAPI spec
* Use `https://petstore.swagger.io/` and point the query param `url` to a raw file in this repository.
For example: https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ericsson/ecchronos/master/docs/autogenerated/openapi.yaml
* Start ecChronos locally and edit `application.yml` to have `springdoc.api-docs.enabled: true` (it's disabled by default).
The swagger ui should be accessible at `<ecchronos:port>/swagger-ui/index.html`
