Story Description:

It is important to contextualize the objective, which is a task with a purpose. Therefore, it describes the current system's behavior and its proposed improvement/correction. Additionally, it should reference where the potential change should be made if the user story author has this information. This is to avoid asking the author basic questions that could have been avoided by providing more detailed information in the user story.

To determine if the description is good, you can use a golden rule, which is to ask yourself the following question: "If I was not aware of the content of this user story, could I start working just by reading the description and the code?"

Acceptance Criteria:

[Acceptance Criterion 1]: Describe a specific condition that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.

[Acceptance Criterion 2]: Add another condition or requirement that ensures the story's functionality.

[Acceptance Criterion 3]: Continue to list all relevant criteria that need to be satisfied.

Definition of Done:

[List any additional requirements or steps that need to be completed before considering the user story done.]

Notes:

[Include any additional information, constraints, or considerations related to the user story.]
