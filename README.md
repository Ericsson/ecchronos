ecChronos is a decentralized scheduling framework primarily focused on performing automatic repairs in Apache Cassandra.

## Getting started

See the [STRUCTURE.md](docs/STRUCTURE.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on ecChronos project structure and architecture.

### Prerequisites

PLACEHOLDER

### Installing

After running `mvn clean package assembly:single` in the project root unpack the file `application/target/ecChronos-<version>-binary.tar.gz`.
The root directory should contain the following:
```
bin/
conf/
lib/
licenses/
statistics/
LICENSE.txt
NOTICE.txt
```

Change the configuration in `conf/ecChronos.cfg`.
To get started the connection properties needs to match your local setup:

```
### Native connection properties
#connection.native.host=localhost
#connection.native.port=9042

### JMX connection properties
#connection.jmx.host=localhost
#connection.jmx.port=7199
```

Update the replication in `standalone-integration/src/main/resources/create_keyspaces.cql` to match your configuration.
The keyspace `ecchronos` must be replicated to all data centers.
After the file has been modified run the following command:
```
cqlsh -f standalone-integration/src/main/resources/create_keyspaces.cql
```

To run ecChronos execute `bin/ecChronos` from the root directory.
With the default setup a logfile will be created in the root directory called `ecChronos.log`.

## Running the tests

There are two different test suites that can be run.
The first suite consist only of unit tests which can be run by `mvn clean install`.
These test will in some cases use an embedded Apache Cassandra.

The second suite consist of the unit tests as well as integration tests which can be run by `mvn clean install -P osgi-integration-tests,standalone-integration-tests`.
The integration tests start docker instances of Apache Cassandra to get a cluster environment where repair can run.
It is possible to run either OSGi integration tests or the standalone tests without the other.
This can be done by running either `mvn clean install -P osgi-integration-tests` or `mvn clean install-P standalone-integration-tests`.

### Maven configuration properties

| Property                   | Default    | Description                                              |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| it.cassandra.memory        | 2147483648 | Memory limit for the docker instance                     |
| it.cassandra.heap          | 1G         | Amount of heap memory Cassandra should use at most       |
| it.cassandra.ring.delay.ms | 2000       | Bootstrap delay in Cassandra (-Dcassandra.ring_delay_ms) |

### Running within IDEA/Eclipse

If you already have a three node cluster setup (through docker, ccm, etc) this can be used instead.

Make sure to run the following command (with correct data centers specified in the create_keyspaces.cql) to prepare the cluster.
```
cqlsh -f standalone-integration/src/test/resources/create_keyspaces.cql
```

The test cases needs to be run with the following system properties set:

| Variable                 |  Description                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| it-cassandra.ip          | The host ip of one of the Cassandra instances |
| it-cassandra.native.port | The native port used                          |
| it-cassandra.jmx.port    | The JMX port used                             |


### Break down into end to end tests

The `standalone-integration` tests runs a setup similar to the standalone application to verify automated repairs.
The `osgi-integration` tests runs in a OSGi environment to verify that all services are available and verifies automated repairs.
