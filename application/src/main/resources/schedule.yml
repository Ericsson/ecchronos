## The schedules can be defined using exact keyspace/table names.
## It's also possible to define the names using quoted regular expressions.
##
## When the repair scheduler configures repairs it configures in the following order:
##
## 1. Defined tables (ks1/tb1)
## 2. Defined keyspaces with regex tables (ks1/[a-Z]123)
## 3. Regex Keyspaces with defined tables ([a-Z]abc/tb2)
## 4. Regex keyspaces with regex tables ([a-Z]abc/[a-Z]123)
##
## Multiple regular expressions matching a single table should be avoided as it will be difficult
## to know which value will win out.
##

keyspaces:
#  - name: ks1
#    tables:
#    - name: tb1
##
## If repair should be enabled for this table.
## This can be used to disable automatic repairs of certain tables.
##
#      enabled: true
##
## How often repairs should be triggered for the table.
##
#      interval:
#        time: 7
#        unit: days
##
## Alarms are triggered when the table has not been repaired for a long amount of time.
## The warning alarm is meant to indicate early that repairs are falling behind.
## The error alarm is meant to indicate that gc_grace has passed between repairs.
##
## With the defaults where repairs triggers once every 7 days for the table a warning alarm would be raised
## if the table has not been properly repaired within one full day.
##
#      alarm:
#        warn:
#          time: 8
#          unit: days
#        error:
#          time: 10
#          unit: days
##
## Specifies the unwind ratio to smooth out the load that repairs generate.
## This value is a ratio between 0 -> 100% of the execution time of a repair session.
##
## 100% means that the executor will wait to run the next session for as long time as the previous session took.
##
#      unwind_ratio: 0.0
##
## Specifies a target for how much data each repair session should process.
## This is only supported if using 'vnode' as repair_type.
## This is an estimation assuming uniform data distribution among partition keys.
## The value should be either a number or a number with a unit of measurement:
## 12  (12 B)
## 12k (12 KiB)
## 12m (12 MiB)
## 12g (12 GiB)
##
#      size_target:
##
## Specifies the default repair_type.
## Possible values are: vnode, parallel_vnode, incremental
## vnode = repair 1 vnode at a time (supports size_target to split the vnode further, in this case there will be 1 repair session per subrange)
## parallel_vnode = repair vnodes in parallel, this will combine vnodes into a single repair session per repair group
## incremental = repair vnodes incrementally (incremental repair)
##
#      repair_type: vnode
