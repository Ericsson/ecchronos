    ## Certificate Revocation List (CRL) configuration for ecChronos CQL connections. CRL
    ## checking will be done in one of two modes; strict or non-strict. The CRL feature
    ## is optional. If the crl section is not specified, it will default to disabled.
    ##
    ## strict     - A valid and signed CRL must exist for the provided certificate for a
    ##              connection to be allowed. Therefore, a missing or empty CRL file
    ##              will result in rejection. If rejected, a number of attempts will be
    ##              made to refresh the CRL file (for any updates). If the last attempt
    ##              fails, ecChronos will gracefully shut down.
    ##
    ## non-strict - Is more loose in its CRL checking in that already opened connections
    ##              will be kept. CRL will only be carried out during new (re-)connections.
    ##              Also, there must be an explicit revocation present for a certificate
    ##              to be rejected. A missing or empty CRL will not result in rejected
    ##              connections.
